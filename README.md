## Introduction
I'm **Lottie Eucys** but [Lottie] for short. <br>
I started my interest in programming in Senior High School and <br> am still learning and working on a small project to improve my coding knowledge.
> **Note:** I'm in college and still working on how to utilize **Design Patterns** and <br> different **Design Principles** to improve how I execute my code.

# Interest
I'm interested in creating **Discord Bots** and **Minecraft Plugins**. So far, I've created small projects in Minecraft Spigot for my server's use. <br>
> Currently, I'm interested in **TypeScript** and **Python**.

# Learning
It's fun to learn different computer languages and understand the struggles of those people who are learning these languages.<br><br>
I understand but don't know how to fully use them:
- Java
- Node.js
- C++
> I know their fundamentals through self-learning and books, but not everything can be learned in university. Discussing a topic throughout the day and having a new lesson tomorrow, there's no way in heck I'll fully understand that.

Therefore, I'm doing small projects of my own to further enrich my understanding in each language I've learned in university.
