## Introduction
I'm **Lottie Eucys** but [Lottie] for short. <br>
I started my interest in programming in Senior High School and <br> am still learning and working on a small project to improve my coding knowledge.
> **Note:** I'm in college and still working on how to utilize **Design Patterns** and <br> different **Design Principles** to improve how to execute my code.
