## Introduction

I started coding 6 years ago. My first programming language is *Java*.
I've done several small project like Point-of-Sale, Student Management System for Several School
and Library Inventory System. I do some back-end for website and plugins for Minecraft.

## Study

Things that I've learned so far.

- [Java] - I can say that I have a solid foundation when it comes to Java because of my experience in developing various applications,
using API to integrate on my Java application, and using OOP principle when programming.
- [Javascript] - I won't say I'm an expert but I've done several project with Javascript like using it for web development, creating discord
and twitch bot, reactJS application like web-based POS (Yes! I'm obsessed with POS, got a problem with that? it's on demand because many people
now do online selling and always complain that they are using Excel for their business)
- [Python] - more on IoT and some Web Servers.
- [C#] - Doing some experiment like converting my Java Program to C# and implementing it in different way, and also got hook with Asynchronous
in C#.
