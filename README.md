## Introduction

I started coding 6 years ago, with *Java* as my first programming language. I've completed several small projects, including a Point-of-Sale system, a Student Management System for several schools, and a Library Inventory System. I also have experience with backend development for websites and creating plugins for Minecraft.

> I'm from the Philippines and currently pursuing a [Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering]. As of now, I'm in my 3rd year of college. Despite our curriculum still focusing on Java, I've managed to improve myself through self-study, research, joining different communities, and reading documentation for the programming languages I want to learn. Relying solely on my university professors and what I can learn in university wouldn't have gotten me this far.

## Study

Here are the things I've learned so far:

- **Java**: I have a solid foundation in Java, developed through experience in creating various applications, integrating APIs into my Java applications, and applying OOP principles in my programming.
- **JavaScript**: While I don't consider myself an expert, I've worked on several projects using JavaScript. These include web development, creating Discord and Twitch bots, and developing ReactJS applications like web-based POS systems. (Yes, I'm obsessed with POS systems. They're in high demand because many people now do online selling and often complain about using Excel for their business.)
- **Python**: My experience with Python is mostly related to IoT and some web server development.
- **C#**: I've experimented with converting my Java programs to C#, implementing them in different ways, and exploring asynchronous programming in C#.
